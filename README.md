## Getting started

1. `npm i` to install packages.
2. `npm run dev` to scan the html files for classes and build the CSS.
3. `npm run minify` to minify css.

## Miscellaneous

I use VS Code and use the following extensions:

1. Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
2. Live Server (Five Server)
    - To use: Right-Click dist in the Explorer > Open with Five Server (root)
